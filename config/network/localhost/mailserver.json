I'm not going to lie to you, you guys are doing me a favor both professionally and personally. Your target to locate is the ship 'Byrni's Bounty' and her crew. The ship itself is a Far Trader. Shes been in service for years, got a few tune ups that have kept her flying on more than one occassion. Can't imagine she would go down easily.  As for the crew she usually ships out with a complement of 10. Due to unfortunate circumstances 3 of the usual are in the hospital with injuries resulting from a cargo loading accident. Another 2 just had a baby and settled planetside while they get settled. Sandol is the captain you're looking for.  I can't remember the rest off the top of my head, but I can have my secretary send you the ships departure log later.  They're good folks but its not like them to be overdue.  -Texax Harrison  GeDeCo Quartermaster #18009"

I dont know too much about the guy except for the description that was given to me-seems like hes a pretty experienced cat. I wouldn't wanna get on his bad side. Rugged individual by the sound of it, career intelligence for the court in Drinax.  No clue as to what he was doing out here or why he's missing, but thats not what we get paid for is it? Guys got a cybernetic arm too. Shouldn't be too hard to search the guy out. Last we heard he was piloting some customed out Scout Type-R, designate the Dragon's Fang. Pretty cool name.  Anyways best of luck. I had a courier deliver the encoded signet ring to help make the rendezvous a little smoother.  Happy hunting! I'll beat your ass in cards next time I see ya though."
