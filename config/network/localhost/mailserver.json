I dont know too much about the guy except for the description that was given to me-seems like hes a pretty experienced cat. I wouldn't wanna get on his bad side. Rugged individual by the sound of it, career intelligence for the court in Drinax.  No clue as to what he was doing out here or why he's missing, but thats not what we get paid for is it? Guys got a cybernetic arm too. Shouldn't be too hard to search the guy out. Last we heard he was piloting some customed out Scout Type-R, designate the Dragon's Fang. Pretty cool name.  Anyways best of luck. I had a courier deliver the encoded signet ring to help make the rendezvous a little smoother.  Happy hunting! I'll beat your ass in cards next time I see ya though."
